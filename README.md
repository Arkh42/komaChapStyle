# komaChapStyle

A chapterstyle-like command (as memoir) for the KOMA-Script bundle.


The `memoir` class offers the `\chapterstyle{}` interface to modify the style of chapter headings.
Many styles are described in the [class documentation](http://mirror.koddos.net/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/memman.pdf).
More styles have been collected by Lars Madsen and presented [here](ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/MemoirChapStyles/MemoirChapStyles.pdf).

The goal of this repository is to offer a similar feature to the KOMA-Script bundle.
